To perform all R analyses in "An extension of the Cx(Co)^m model of crossover patterning to account for experimental mortality in \_Drosophila melanogaster\_" you will need to run the script:
1_missing\_data\_driver\_script.R which sources each of the required scripts, as well as loading the package dfoptim() and setting the working directory. This script will load the raw data from the directory "Raw Data" and send outputs to the directory "Summaries and Outputs".
