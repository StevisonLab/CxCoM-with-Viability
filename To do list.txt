To do list:

-Make script to combine egg count datasets between observers and split into marker free and marker present
-Export adult count datasets from separate excel worksheets into individual CSV files; also pull out phenotypic class worksheets and put in main raw data folder
-Add adult count to R script and incorporate measures of survival 
-Output needs to feed into next script Viability Goodness of Fit

-update script 2 to work within this directory structure 

-Make 3rd script to read in exported CSV from recombination data and reorganize in preparation for counting model (Melika will provide some templates from her project)

-Split script 4 of the counting model into separate scripts - two for the main functions and one that is a driver and separate scripts for each hypothesis
